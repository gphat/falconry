# Falconry

Falconry is a small javascript for monitoring [Kestrel](https://github.com/robey/kestrel).

Simply open the index.html and enter the URL for your instance of kestrel.
You can also browse to [http://gphat.github.com/falconry/](http://gphat.github.com/falconry/)
and run the latest version without checking anything out.

Only works with Kestrel 2.2.0.
